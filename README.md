It's time consuming to calculate each person's share for dinner, when one person paid the restaurant... Why not automate? 

## Sceniaro ##
A group of friends order food online. The order is placed by one person for say five other friends. Adjusting for tip and tax, and calculating each person's owed share is cumbersome if done manually. This app simplifies that.

## Potential Features: ##
 * reciept scanning OCR
 * single person can order multiple dishes
 * adjust for tax and tip
 * link with food delivery apps?
